## data structure in python
1.List, string and tuples are ordered collection. Set and dictionary are unordered collection.

2.Data objects from list need not to be from the same class.

3.Lists are mutable, strings are immutable.Sets don't allow duplicates


## OOP
1. Is-a relationship and Has-a relationship

## big-O
1.List indexing and assigning to an index position are independent of the size of the list.(O(1))
2.Using append to grow a list:O(1), using concatenation operator:O(k)
